# Authentication

Test and integrate **Token Authentication** to your Applications. 

Try to answer following questions:

- How to receive Tokens for Authentication?
- Which benefits exist if you are using such Tokens for User Authentication?
- What are possible risks if you are not using Authentication and Autorization with e.g. Tokens? 


## JSON Web Tokens

Those steps should guide you through implementing JSON Web Tokens. 

**Use about 3x45minutes** to go through JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Feel free to integrate in your existing app or to create a small demo application.

- Define (REST) API
- Authentication by Username and Password
- Receive your Token
- Use this Token for Authentication
- Use Local Storage to keep Token persistent
- Use token within Web Socket
