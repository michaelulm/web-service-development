# REST testing

In this exercise, we will test our REST-Service.  
The service is more or less the same as from the initial [REST exercise](../../nodejs/rest/).

We just have removed the SQLite Database and add instead a simple "in memory" replacement.

Now it is on you to create tests for all implemented REST-calls (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).

Create at least one test for each method (GET (all), GET (by id), POST, PUT, DELETE).  

If you're not familiar with the service, check the code or simple start it (`npm start`) and test its behavior.
